# Seasonality Analysis with Fourier Transforms
## Code and data for my Medium articles on analyzing seasonality using Fourier transforms

Clone the repo and please open the `notebooks` folder to view my work. [Here](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) are instructions on installing Jupyter.

The raw 911 phone call data is too large for Github. Please download it from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/montcoalert) and put in in the data folder. You'll need to rename it to `PA_911_calls.csv`.
